## Tasks to Process

Please process the following task files from /Needs_Action:

- `FILE_DROP_text_md_20260226_194727.md`

## Processing Instructions

For EACH task file:

1. **Read the action file** - Parse the YAML frontmatter and content
2. **Understand the task** - Identify what action is required
3. **Check Company_Handbook.md** - Follow the Rules of Engagement
4. **Create a plan** - Write a Plan.md file in /Plans/ with checkboxes
5. **Execute the plan** - Complete each step
6. **Update Dashboard.md** - Log the activity in the Recent Activity table
7. **Move to Done** - After completion, move the task file to /Done/

## Important Rules

- **Approval Required**: If an action requires human approval (see Company_Handbook.md approval thresholds), create a file in /Pending_Approval/ instead of acting directly
- **Logging**: Log all actions to /Logs/
- **Error Handling**: If you encounter an error, create an error log and move the file to a safe location

## Output Format

- Tasks completed: [count]
- Tasks requiring approval: [count]
